## About the app:
Mini Mining is a game that mixes adventures, strategies, and mining with the unique objective to go deeper and deeper and find what makes this little village so intriguing. 

Upgrade your stats, sell unique ores, and discover an exceptional world full of mysteries and hidden treasures. Try to find every mysterious object deeply buried in the ground and gather every Dig Skin available.

If you liked Motherload or Mega Miner, Mini Mining is for you. It will revive the nostalgia of those old games in a pixel mobile version.
